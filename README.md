## Instructions

The game aims to develop the player's memory: player opens the first card and remembers its position, if the second opened card does not match, player should open another pair, unmatched cards are closed again. If the cards matched, they stay open. Therefore, the the number of elements to remember reduces as the game proceeds. From the beginning of the game the user is attributed 3 stars, the number of stars reduces dynamically with the number of moves made by the player (the move equals to 2 clicks to match the cards). The number of stars and the time is displayed in the final success window, which appears when all cards are matched.
